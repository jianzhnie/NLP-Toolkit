class RNNEncoder(nn.Module):
    r"""
    A RNNEncoder takes as input a sequence of vectors and returns a
    single vector, which is a combination of multiple `paddle.nn.RNN
    <https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/documentation/docs/en/api
    /paddle/nn/layer/rnn/RNN_en.html>`__ subclass.
    The input to this encoder is of shape `(batch_size, num_tokens, input_size)`,
    The output is of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size * 2)` if RNN is bidirection;
    If not, output is of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`.

    Paddle's RNN have two outputs: the hidden state for every time step at last layer,
    and the hidden state at the last time step for every layer.
    If `pooling_type` is not None, we perform the pooling on the hidden state of every time
    step at last layer to create a single vector. If None, we use the hidden state
    of the last time step at last layer as a single output (shape of `(batch_size, hidden_size)`);
    And if direction is bidirection, the we concat the hidden state of the last forward
    rnn and backward rnn layer to create a single vector (shape of `(batch_size, hidden_size * 2)`).

    Args:
        input_size (int):
            The number of expected features in the input (the last dimension).
        hidden_size (int):
            The number of features in the hidden state.
        num_layers (int, optional):
            Number of recurrent layers.
            E.g., setting num_layers=2 would mean stacking two RNNs together to form a stacked RNN,
            with the second RNN taking in outputs of the first RNN and computing the final results.
            Defaults to 1.
        direction (str, optional):
            The direction of the network. It can be "forward" and "bidirect"
            (it means bidirection network). If "biderect", it is a birectional RNN,
            and returns the concat output from both directions. Defaults to "forward"
        dropout (float, optional):
            If non-zero, introduces a Dropout layer on the outputs of each RNN layer
            except the last layer, with dropout probability equal to dropout.
            Defaults to 0.0.
        pooling_type (str, optional):
            If `pooling_type` is None, then the RNNEncoder will return the hidden state
            of the last time step at last layer as a single vector.
            If pooling_type is not None, it must be one of "sum", "max" and "mean".
            Then it will be pooled on the RNN output (the hidden state of every time
            step at last layer) to create a single vector.
            Defaults to `None`.
